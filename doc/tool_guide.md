## Explanation

### Soldering iron

I do not recommend soldering irons from 100 yen shops.

From [WEBはんだ付け講座 はじめに・・](https://noseseiki.com/kisokouza/01.html)

> Currently, in Japan, soldering irons with no temperature control function are used by the majority of people who solder. These soldering irons have a too high tip temperature of 450-550 ° C. For this reason, most products soldered with this soldering iron will be overheated.

If you don't have much soldering experience or have done it a long time ago, we strongly recommend that you prepare one with temperature control.

### Replacement tip

Since the conical shape attached to the soldering iron from the beginning hits the target and the point, it is difficult for heat to be transmitted, and solder may be placed due to insufficient heating, so replace it with the 2C tip and heat on the surface It is easy to do it if you can.

### Soldering iron stand

Necessary for safely placing the soldering iron.

### Solder blotter or wire

It is good to have it because it is not necessary when soldering fails.

### Nipper

It is used for cutting board / biscuits, cutting diode legs / pin headers.

Nippers are not recommended for 100 yen shops for the following reasons.

- Sharpness is not so good, and it is difficult to cut the diode feet and pin header.
- Since the blade is not a sword, it cannot be cut

### Tester

Necessary for problem isolation when keys cannot be entered.

All you need is a conduction mode.

### Electronic work solder

Leaded type is easy to work with.

Since there are no particularly small parts used for SU120, even a 1mm one can work well, but 0.8mm seems to melt the solder easily.

### Epoxy adhesive two-component mixed type

Used for Pro Micro baldness prevention processing.

### Masking tape

It is used to fix parts when turning the board over by soldering.
